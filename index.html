        <h1>Sarah Reynolds</h1>
        <p><em><strong>Freelance English Teacher</strong> and <strong>Junior Developer</strong></em></p>
        <p>I have been teaching English to children and adults from around the world for more than six years. Whilst
        living in Vietnam, I became CELTA certified. My teaching has been carried out in both classrooms as well
        as online. As for programming, I am currently learning how to code with the Python Programming Language. It is
        my goal to merge these two professions in order to create useful apps and websites to help people learn English
        for free.</p>
